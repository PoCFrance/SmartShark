# SmartShark

>## <b>Logbook</b>
> This is a small presentation on what progress we made trough time. Each point will represent the outcome of a meeting (wich happen every week).
>* <b>WEEK 00 (27/03/2020)</b>
>   <pre>A global presentaion where made about the project in this session, our referant told us what <b>SmartShark</b> was all about, and what tools we could use.</pre>
>* <b>WEEK 01 (01/04/2020)</b>
>   <pre>At this time point, we where abble to understand how WireShark and TShark worked (in the big line), and we worked out that TenserFlow 2.0 would be the best framework to use as a tool for machin lurning</pre>
>* <b>WEEK 02 (08/04/2020)</b>
>   <pre>Since the last week we worked with TShark and managed to get live info in a pcap file to use in a possible futur programme. Also we lurned more from TenserFlow trough some tutorial to abble to use it later.</pre>
>* <b>WEEK 03 (15/04/2020)</b>
>   <pre>We trained ourselves with TensorFlow thanks to some task given to us by our referents, and thanks to those task we lurned that the use of an non supervise mnist algorithm would be hard to use in our cases. Also we made some research to have a better understanding of DDOS attack in a network</pre>
>* <b>WEEK 04 (22/04/2020)</b>
>   <pre>We manange to think that an anomaly detector algorithm would be a good choice of algorithme. Also, our surch for dataset to use for our machin lurning programme were unconcluant, we needed more time to find a good dataset to use.</pre>
>* <b>WEEK 05 (29/04/2020)</b>
>   <pre>We finally found a good dataset and we are abble to extract information from it throug some code that Valentin wrote. Furthemore, instead of using an unsupervised machin lurning algorithme, we would use a supervised algorithme (we conclude that it would be a better thing in our case scenario).</pre>
>* <b>WEEK 06 (06/05/2020)</b>
>   <pre>Thanks to some code and TanserFlow (and all we lurned since the beginng) we finally arrive at a point where our AI is abble to reconize a DDOS attack (in some case scenario) with a good accuracy.</pre>
